Go to any mobile money agent anywhere in Africa and you will probably find a large book under the table used for bookkeeping.  
A small investment of a few dollars for a rechargeable tablet would allow this business to save time and greatly increase productivity. 

This post discusses some common themes across African states and businesses so that they stay competitive in the global landscape.  

# A diverse continent

Africa is a fascinating continent of 54 countries and 1000s of languages. 
It offers a unique combination of opportunities and challenges. 

It is home to one of the [youngest][1] populations on the planet; in the next few decades it will be the only continent 
with a [growing young generation][2]. Young people of this generation, at the peak of their productivity and ambition, 
will start their own businesses, buy their first appliances, their first motorbike, their first car.  
This onwards and upwards expansion can be seen in the continent’s economies. Outside of Asia, it is the only other 
continent with consistently expanding economies. Admittedly starting from a low base, [Africa][3] is host to a number of 
countries with [consistent double digit growth][4] over the last decades. 

Asian countries “came of age” in the half-century of the [shipping container][5], building their economies on the basis 
of industrialization. African countries are escaping the [LDC][6] bracket and becoming [frontier][7] and emerging markets 
in the half-century of mobile internet.  
Mobile money is Africa’s [greatest technological innovation and export][8]. Also known as M-pesa, mobile money has 
unleashed a flurry of [fintech innovation][9]. It is being copied around the [developing world][10] to facilitate 
[seamless transactions][11] for businesses and individuals. 


# ...with a number of challenges

One could say we have entered the century of Africa. However there are a number of very important challenges, common 
to most countries of the continent. 

Despite their young dynamic workforce, African countries are consistently [behind in industrialization][12], which would 
unlock a large number of needed jobs. Having one of the lowest labour costs in the world, is not enough; like-for-like, 
real industrial costs are [higher than comparable countries][13] elsewhere in the world, discouraging large-scale industrialisation 

Infrastructure matters. Infrastructure ownership matters even more.  
Most of Africa’s connections to the rest of the world is externally provided, for example [internet fibre cables][14] 
and [satellite][15]. It is quite telling that pan-African (or globally African) infrastructure players can be counted [on one hand][17].   
Foreign direct investment in Africa traditionally favours [extractive assets][18] with high RoI, producing some income 
for the host country. However, across the continent there is a distinct lack of [infrastructure][19] which may not offer 
immediate yield but acts as a multiplier for economic activity (e.g. street lighting, electricity grid, paved roads,...). 

African business, especially SMEs, are facing some unique [challenges][20]. The majority of them are trying to adapt 
either using antiquated manual methods or by blindly consuming new technologies. The former is too slow, the latter is 
not always appropriate to local problems. Local innovation is still in its nascent phase, combining tried-and-tested 
methods with modern technology. 

# Building the future

Given Africa’s diversity, the initial reaction would be to treat each country’s technological problems separately. This 
approach would miss the fact that almost all African countries face more or less similar problems. A combined focus on 
these would unlock Africa’s potential for competition at the international stage. 

## Infrastructure
African states have to think of [innovation][21] in terms of creating solutions with a multi-generation impact; this can only 
be done with the right infrastructure in place. Lasting infrastructure development creates social and economic stability, 
turning today’s challenge in tomorrow’s opportunity. A great learning example for African states is China. 60 years ago, 
China was [poorer than most African states][22]. Fast forward to today and trillions of Chinese infrastructure and education 
spending, there is almost a chasm in terms of development between China and the African continent.

## Training
If bridges and high speed trains require billions, the same cannot be said for education and training. Proliferation 
of the internet and mobile devices, allow educational programmes to be provided to a mass audience. Initiated by either 
the state or the private sector, these can be offered at a very low cost and offer [spectacular return of investment][23]. 
The goal would be to provide basic IT knowledge and skills to the average African, who is the backbone of the economy 
through their trading. [E-learning solutions][24] can assist [SMEs][25] (the backbone of African economies) upskill their 
staff and increase productivity.

## Security
Part and parcel with education is cyber-security awareness.  
In the age of rapid digitisation, African countries and businesses are [perilously ill-prepared][26]. 
An increasing number of [attacks][27], some of them of the most basic kind, demonstrate a clear need for training and 
preparation for enterprises and governments. With the widespread adoption of mobile money, educating the general 
population on [best practices][28] and to demand [better security by their providers][29]. Since mobile money has brought millions 
of people out of the “shadow economy”, maintaining a high level of trust and integrity of the system is something governments should take very seriously. 

## Solving the right problems
A continent with diverse challenges requires lateral thinking by everyone, not just governments.  
Though it may be tempting to try and copy “western” ideas (social networks, online marketplaces,...), Africans have a 
much different set of everyday challenges. Abundant materials, patchy infrastructure, climate change, political uncertainty, 
demand for exports,... All of these make an interesting mix of challenges and opportunities which beg for innovative 
technological solutions. African idiosyncracies and traditions from [village banking][30] to [financial heterogeneity][31] 
to [family support networks][32] and [emigration][33] should be embraced and brought to the 21st century with the help 
of technology. 


# Parting thought

The world is changing at an increasing pace.  
African states should avoid becoming the [proverbial frog][33] which is slowly boiled alive.  
Societies on the continent may think they are adapting to the changing world, without recognising the need to jump 
ahead and lead. Not getting the basics right and building on them, creates a real risk for Africa of boiling alive 
whilst asleep.
